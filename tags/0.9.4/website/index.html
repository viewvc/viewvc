    <h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and specific
      revisions of files. It can display diffs between versions and
      show selections of files based on tags or branches. In addition,
      ViewCVS has "annotation" or "blame" support, Bonsai-like query
      facilities, template-based page generation, and support for
      individually configuring virtual hosts.

      It also includes support for
      <a href="http://www.akhphd.au.dk/~bertho/cvsgraph/"><i>CvsGraph</i></a>
      -- a program to display the tree of revisions and branches
      graphically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, the functionality of ViewCVS surpasses that of cvsweb.
      See <a href="#Cvsweb">below</a> for a list of additional features.
    </p>

    <hr width="75&#37;">
    <h2><a name="History">History</a></h2>
    <p>
      The ViewCVS software was inspired by
      <a href="http://stud.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/"><i>cvsweb</i></a>
      (originally written by Bill Fenner and then further developed by 
      <a href="mailto:zeller@think.de">Henner Zeller</a>).
      Greg Stein wanted to make some changes and updates, but cvsweb was
      implemented in Perl. He wrote: 
      <blockquote><i>While I can manage some Perl, cvsweb was
	 rather unmaintainable for me. So I undertook the 
	 task to convert the software to
	 <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. As a result, 
	 I've actually been able to go <em>way</em> beyond the simple
	 changes that I had envisioned.
      </i></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS started as a port of the cvsweb script, but has had
      numerous cleanups and other modifications, based on some of
      Python's strengths. There is still some minor "badness"
      remaining from the Perl code, but Greg has been working on
      flushing that out, while adding new features.
    </p>
    <p>
      ViewCVS has been developed by the <a href="who.html">ViewCVS
	Group</a> and is made available under a
      <a href="license-1.html">BSD-type license</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      ViewCVS requires <strong>Python 1.5</strong> or later (Python
      1.5 has been out for a couple years and is readily available for 
      your favorite operating system). If you choose to use the SQL Checkin 
      Database feature, then you must use <strong>Python 1.5.2</strong> 
      or later and have the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python"><i>MySQLdb
	  module</i></a> installed which itself requires

    <h2><a name="Cvsweb">Additional features over cvsweb</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Template support: you can now customize the look and feel of
        ViewCVS by editing the provided EZT templates, which are used
        to generate the pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Internationalization support: ViewCVS will parse and handle
        the Accept-Language request header, and can select different
        inputs for localized page generation.
      </li>
      <li>
	Colorization for many file types via <code>enscript</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bonsai-like query features. (Requires MySQL and some other
	prerequisites)
      </li>
      <li>
	Annotation/blame viewing support against a <strong>read-only</strong>
	repository.
      </li>
      <li>
	Configuration on a per-virtual-host basis. This allows you
	to share the configuration file and ViewCVS installation
	across virtual hosts, yet still be able to fine-tune the
	options when necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automatic generation of tarballs for the HEAD or a specified
        tag.
      </li>
      <li>
	Runs either as CGI script, called from an installed web server
	(such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/"><i>Apache</i></a>),
	or as a standalone server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Searching files for matches for a regular expression.
      </li>
      <li>Better reporting for unreadable files.</li>
      <li>
	More robust when given varying <code>rcsdiff</code> or
	<code>rlog</code> outputs.
      </li>
      <li>Hard breaks in human-readable diffs.</li>
      <li>
	The configuration file is optional (you can change the values
	right in the CGI script and avoid the config file, if you so
	choose). The config file syntax is also cleaner, since it is
	human-manageable rather than source code.
      </li>
      <li>
	Directories with a large number of files can be viewed.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Security</strong>: ViewCVS only requires read access
	to the CVS repository (not read/write). With the correct
	security partitioning, this means that even if ViewCVS were to 
	be subverted, your source code is safe. Further, ViewCVS does
	not use any <code>system()</code> or <code>popen()</code>
	calls, which are very susceptible to abuse.
	<br>
	<small>(cvsweb had a hole due to a popen() call)</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        Last but not least: it doesn't suffer from the "unmaintainable
	code effect" that hits most Perl projects sooner or later:  
	<blockquote><i>[Perl] combines all the worst aspects of C and Lisp: 
	  a billion different sublanguages in one monolithic executable.  
	  It combines the power of C with the readability of PostScript.</i>
					       --&nbsp;Jamie&nbsp;Zawinski

    <h2><a name="Future">Future features, directions</a></h2>
    <p>
    ViewCVS is a Open Source project.  So any future development depends
    on the contributions that will be made by its user community.  
    Certainly working patches have a greater chance to become realized 
    quickly than feature requests.  <i>But don't hesitate to submit your
	suggestions! Send mail to the
	  <a href="mailto:viewcvs@lyra.org">viewcvs@lyra.org</a>
	  mailing list or even better use the 
	  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=18760&atid=368760">SF&nbsp;tracker</a>.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>See the feature requests already submitted through
        the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=368760&group_id=18760&func=browse">SF feature request tracker</a>
      </li>
      <li>UI streamlining/simplification</li>
      <li>Integration with CVS checkin auto-mail scripts</li>
      <li>Tighter integration with the query features</li>
     <p>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And another longer term pet of Greg Stein:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration with an indexer such as LXR</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <hr width="75&#37;">
    <h2><a name="Colorize">Colorization of files</a></h2>
    <p>
      ViewCVS can make use of the <code>enscript</code> program to
      colorize files in the CVS repository. If <code>enscript</code>
      is present on your system, then set the
      <code>use_enscript</code> option in the
      <code>viewcvs.conf</code> configuration file to <code>1</code>. 
      If necessary,
      update the <code>enscript_path</code> option to point to your
      installation directory. ... That's it! Now, as you view files
      through ViewCVS, they will be colored.
    </p>

    <h3>Colorization of Python files</h3>
    <p>
      ViewCVS currently also comes with a builtin colorizer for Python
      source files. This may go away in a future version, given the new
      <code>enscript</code> support...
    </p>
    <p>
      Christophe Pelte suggested this feature: colorize Python source
      files using
      <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/SoftwareDescriptions.html#py2html.py"><i>py2html</i></a>
      (by Marc-Andrew Lemburg, based on
      <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/just/code/PyFontify.py"><i>PyFontify</i></a>
      by Just van Rossum). I've added this feature to ViewCVS 0.3,
      along with a generalized plugin mechanism for custom coloring other
      types of files. See the instructions within the viewcvs.cgi for
      setting the <code>py2html_path</code> configuration variable if
      you want to use this feature.
