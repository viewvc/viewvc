The following people have commit access to the ViewVC sources.
Note that this is not a full list of ViewVC's authors, however --
for that, you'd need to look over the log messages to see all the
patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail
dev@viewvc.tigris.org, rather than mailing any of these people
directly.
