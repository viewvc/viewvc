"""Parse an RCS file, showing the rcsparse callbacks that are called.

This program is useful to see whether an RCS file has a problem (in
the sense of not being parseable by rcsparse) and also to illuminate
the correspondence between RCS file contents and rcsparse callbacks.

The output of this program can also be considered to be a kind of
'canonical' format for RCS files, at least in so far as rcsparse
returns all relevant information in the file and provided that the
order of callbacks is always the same."""
