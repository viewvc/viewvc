    REVISION is a string containing a revision number.  This may be

    The revision number consists of a number of decimal components separated

    components, it's a branch.  Otherwise, if the next-to-last component is
    zero, it's a branch (and the next-to-last component is an artifact of
    CVS and should not be shown to the user).  Otherwise, it's a tag.

    TIMESTAMP is the date and time that the revision was created, as an
    integer number of seconds since the epoch.  (I.e. "UNIX time" format).
    AUTHOR is the author name, as a string.
    STATE is the state of the revision, as a string.  Common values are

    BRANCHES is a list of strings, with each string being an actual

    on this revision and has commits, the revision number of the first

    NEXT is either None or a string representing an actual revision number

    When on trunk, NEXT points to what humans might consider to be the
    'previous' revision number.  For example, 1.3's NEXT is 1.2.

    consider to be the 'next' revision number.  For example, 1.1.2.1's
