# computer's time zone is changed. UTC also avoids the ambiguity associated
# with daylight saving time (for example if a computer in New York recorded the
# local time 2002/10/27 1:30 am, there would be no way to tell whether the
# actual time was recorded before or after clocks were rolled back). Use local
# times for compatibility with databases used by ViewCVS 0.92 and earlier
