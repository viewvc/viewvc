# ViewVC - Version Control Browser Interface

ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. It generates templatized HTML to present navigable directory, revision, and change log listings. It can display specific versions of files as well as diffs between those versions. Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like functionality you expect out of your version control tool, but much more prettily than the average textual command-line program output.

## Features

*   Support CVS, Subversion and Git repositories.
    - Filesystem-accessible CVS repositories (with limited CVSNT support).
    - Filesystem-accessible and remote Subversion repositories.
    - Filesystem-accessible Git repositories (experimental and not fully supported)
*   Path-based authorization, including Subversion access file support.
*   Template-driven output generation.
*   Support for both CGI and WSGI deployment.
*   Line-based annotation/blame display.
*   Syntax highlighting support.
*   Colorized, side-by-side differences.
*   Revision graph capabilities (via integration with `cvsgraph`) (_CVS only_).
*   Individually configurable virtual host support.
*   Tarball generation.
    - By tag/branch for CVS.
    - By revision and (sub)directory for Subversion and Git.
*   Optional commits database and query interface.
    - Supports file-based commits for both CVS and Subversion.
    - RSS feed generation for committed changes.
*   Localization support based on the Accept-Language request header.
*   Regexp-based file filtering.
*   File-based configuration (no code tweaks required)!
*   Standalone server (for easily testing configuration).

## Requirements

The only hard software requirement for running ViewVC is a suitable version of Python. The specifics of that, as well as all other requirements, depend on what you want to do with the tool. As those have changed somewhat over the years, it's best to consult the INSTALL file of the specific ViewVC release you wish to evaluate for its exact requirements. Here are pointers to the INSTALL files for the current major release lines:

*   [Unreleased bleeding edge (1.3-dev)](https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/blob/master/INSTALL)
*   [ViewVC 1.2.x (Python2; security fixes only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viewvc/viewvc/1.2.x/INSTALL)

## Getting ViewVC

Official ViewVC release archives are available for download at https://viewvc.org/downloads/.  To see what changes have been included in the release, see the [CHANGES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viewvc/viewvc/master/CHANGES) file.

Un-official nightly builds are available at https://viewvc.org/nightly/

## Upgrading

We've tried to ensure that ViewVC URLs are stable, and that even when we deprecate a particular URL syntax, we continue to support the handling of it (using HTTP redirects to point browsers to the new form of that URL). We know that ViewVC URLs get bookmarked, and nobody likes when their bookmarked URLs suddenly stop working.

Across patch releases of ViewVC (when only the Z component of version X.Y.Z changes), we do our best to avoid configuration file changes that would modify the behavior of existing ViewVC installations.  For example, we may add new configuration options, but their default values will cause no change in behavior.  Likewise, we may add new template data dictionary variables, but will not require their use in existing templates or modify the behavior of previously existing data dictionary items.  This makes it much easier for folks who need to upgrade quickly to get security or other bug fixes. That said, across major and minor releases, all bets are off, and chances are good that we've done some major plumbing. When upgrading your ViewVC instance across major or minor version numbers, you'll almost certainly want to consult the "Upgrading HOWTO" document in the `docs/` directory of the release archive for tips on how to migrate your configuration files and any template customizations you've made into their new formats.
