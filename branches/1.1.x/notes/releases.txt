                        RELEASE MANAGEMENT

ViewVC rolls releases from release branches associate with each minor
version of the software.  For example, the 1.1.0 is rolled from the
1.1.x branch.  The same is true for the 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ... releases.

There is a script, `tools/make-release', which creates a release
directory and the various archive files that we distribute.  All other
steps required to get a ViewVC release out of the door require manual
execution (currently by C. Michael Pilato).  Those steps are as
follows:

Checkout a working copy of the release branch for the release you
intend to roll, and in that working copy, perform the following steps
(X, Y, and Z below represent integral major, minor, and patch version
numbers, and not literal):

1.  Review any open bug reports:

       http://viewvc.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues

2.  Add a new subsection to the file 'docs/upgrading.html' describing
    all user visible changes for users of previous releases of ViewVC.
    Commit any modifications.  NOTE: This step should not be necessary
    for patch releases.

3.  Verify that copyright years are correct in both the license-1.html
    file and the source code.

4.  Update and commit the 'CHANGES' file.

5.  Test, test, test!  There is no automatic testsuite available.  So
    just run with permuting different `viewvc.conf' settings... and
    pray.  Fix what needs fixin', keeping the CHANGES file in sync
    with the branch.

6.  At this point, the source code committed to the release branch
    should exactly reflect what you wish to distribute and dub "the
    release".

7.  Edit the file 'lib/viewvc.py' and remove the "-dev" suffix from
    __version__.  The remainder should be of the form "X.Y.Z", where X,
    Y, and Z are positive integers.  Do NOT commit this change.

8.  Update your working copy to HEAD, and tag the release:

       svn update
       svn cp -m "Tag the X.Y.Z final release." . \
                 http://viewvc.tigris.org/svn/viewvc/tags/X.Y.Z

9.  Go into an empty directory and run the 'make-release' script:

       tools/make-release viewvc-X.Y.Z tags/X.Y.Z

10. Verify the archive files:

       - do they have a LICENSE.html file?
       - do they have necessary include documentation?
       - do they *not* have unnecessary stuff?
       - do they install and work correctly?

11. Upload the created archive files (tar.gz and zip) into the Files
    and Documents section of the Tigris.org project, and modify the
    CHECKSUMS document there accordingly.  Also, drop a copy of the
    archive files into the root directory of the viewvc.org website
    (unversioned).

12. On trunk, update the websites (both the viewvc.org/ and www/ ones)
    to refer to the new release files, and copy the CHANGES for the
    new release into trunk's CHANGES file.

13. Edit the file 'lib/viewvc.py' again, re-adding the "-dev" suffix
    and incrementing the patch number assigned to the __version__
    variable, and add a new empty block in the branch's CHANGES file,
    and commit:

       svn ci -m "Begin a new release cycle."

14. Edit the Issue Tracker configuration options, adding a new Version
    for the just-released one, and a new Milestone for the next patch
    (and possibly, minor or major) release.  (For the Milestone sort
    key, use a packed integer XXYYZZ:  1.0.3 == 10003, 2.11.4 == 21104.)

15. Write an announcement explaining all the cool new features and
    post it to the announce@ list, to the project's News area, and to
    other places interested in this sort of stuff, such as Freshmeat
    (http://www.freshmeat.net).
