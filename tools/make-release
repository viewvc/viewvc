### Grab an export from the Subversion repository.

  ### Various shifting, cleanup.  

  # Documentation is now also distributed together with the release, but
  # we still copy the license file to its traditional place (it is small
  # and many files still contain comments refering to this location):

  # Remove some not useful directories

    if [ -e ${JUNK} ]; then
      rm -f ${JUNK}

  find ${TARGET} -print | xargs chmod uoa+r
  find ${TARGET} -type d -print | xargs chmod uoa+x

  if test ${PLATFORM} = windows; then
    # Create also a ZIP file for those poor souls :-) still using Windows: 
    zip -qor9 ${TARGET}.zip ${TARGET}

    # Cut the tarball:
    tar cf - ${TARGET} | gzip -9 > ${TARGET}.tar.gz
  fi

  # remove target directory
